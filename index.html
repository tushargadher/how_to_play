            <h1>Gameplay</h1><br>
            <p> The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a
                row in
                a 4-by-4 grid.</p><br>

            <p>To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3-by-3 or 4-by-4.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and
                Os
                on
                the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all
                squares
                on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player
                wins. If
                all
                squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.</p>
            <br>

            <p>One of the game's best strategies involves creating a "fork," which is placing your mark in such a way
                that
                you
                have the opportunity to win two ways on your next turn. Your opponent can only block one, thereby, you
                can
                win
                after that.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The gameplay is the same if you are playing on a 4-by-4 grid. The "X" player goes first. And, players
                alternate
                placing Xs and Os on the board until a row is completed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all
                16
                squares are filled. If all 16 squares are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game is a
                draw
            </p>
